# Web Application: Expense Calculator

## Goal  
Develop a web application that calculates key indicators of monthly expenses based on a user's list of expenses.

## Tools  
- **CursorAI** for generating HTML/JS code  
- **CodePen** / **JSFiddle** for testing and prototyping

## Input Format  
The user inputs their expenses as a table with the following columns:

| Category       | Amount ($) |
|----------------|------------|
| Groceries      | 15,000     |
| Rent           | 40,000     |
| Transportation | 5,000      |
| Entertainment  | 10,000     |
| Communication  | 2,000      |
| Gym            | 3,000      |

## Functionality  
The application should provide the following features:

- Add new expenses to the list  
- Calculate the **total amount** of expenses  
- Calculate the **average daily expense** (e.g., total expenses divided by 30 days)  
- Display the **top 3 largest expenses**  

## Expected Result  
After entering the data and clicking the **"Calculate"** button, the application should display:

- Total amount of expenses (e.g., 75,000 $)  
- Average daily expense (e.g., 2,500 $)  
- Top 3 largest expenses (e.g., Rent (40,000), Groceries (15,000), Entertainment (10,000))
